My academic background is composed of Software Engineering and Mathematics. In addition, I specialized in Machine Learning, especially Reinforcement Learning and Computer Vision.<br>
I also had experiences in entrepreneurship through the Pepite program of Sorbonne University, where I led a project to create a product around Deep Learning, and Computer Vision applied to sports. <br>
I started coding when I was ten years old. It developed my passion for problem-solving and algorithmic. Throughout my academic career, I continued to do so with side projects and freelancing.<br>

I work hard to learn the latest state-of-the-art algorithms and methods of Machine Learning and master them to bring and create value.<br>
I have advanced knowledge in Deep Learning architectures (CNN, VAE, Deep-Q-Learning, Etc.) and methods (Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement Learning), and engineering technologies going from MLOps, CI/CD, Docker, and much more tools.<br>
I am open-minded, hard-working, and inquisitive. I like to take the initiative and am open to any opportunity to develop solutions to interesting problems.<br>
